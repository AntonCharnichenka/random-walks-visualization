random walks visualization

This application allows to create random walks vizualizations, 
which are stochastic or random processes, that describe a path 
that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space 
such as the integers

Requirements: matplotlib library

To build a visualization run 'random walk vizualization.py'
